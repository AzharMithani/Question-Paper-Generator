1.Does the fact ¨Spouse(George, Laura) follow from the facts Jim = George and Spouse(Jim, Laura)? If so, give a proof; if not, supply additional axioms as needed. What happens if we use Spouse as a unary function symbol instead of a binary predicate?--(5) REM

2.Given the action schemas and initial state from Figure 10.1, what are all the applicable concrete instances of Fly(p, from,to) in the state described by At(P1, JFK) ? At(P2, SFO) ? Plane(P1) ? Plane(P2) ? Airport(JFK ) ? Airport(SFO) ?--(5) UND

facing north. You can turn the robot to face north, east, south, or west. You can direct the robot to move forward a certain distance, although it will stop before hitting a wall. a. Formulate this problem. How large is the state space? b. In navigating a maze, the only place we need to turn is at the intersection of two or more corridors. Reformulate this problem using this observation. How large is the state space now? c. Fromeach point in the maze, we can move in any of the four directions until we reach a turning point, and this is the only action we need to do. Reformulate the problem using these actions. Do we need to keep track of the robotís orientation now? d. In our initial description of the problem we already abstracted from the real world, restricting actions and removing details. List three such simpli?cations we made--(5) Analyze

4.Let us examine the rationality of various vacuum-cleaner agent functions.
a. Show that the simple vacuum-cleaner agent function described in Figure 2.3 is indeed
rational under the assumptions listed on page 38.
b. Describe a rational agent function for the case in which each movement costs one point.
Does the corresponding agent program require internal state?
c. Discuss possible agent designs for the cases in which clean squares can become dirty
and the geography of the environment is unknown. Does it make sense for the agent to
learn from its experience in these cases? If so, what should it learn? If not, why not?--(5) Analyze

OR

5.Read Turingís original paper on AI (Turing, 1950). In the paper, he discusses several
objections to his proposed enterprise and his test for intelligence. Which objections still carry
weight? Are his refutations valid? Can you think of new objections arising from developments
since he wrote the paper? In the paper, he predicts that, by the year 2000, a computer
will have a 30% chance of passing a five-minute Turing Test with an unskilled interrogator.
What chance do you think a computer would have today? In another 50 years--(2) REM

6.Prove that backward search with PDDL problems is complete--(8) Evaluate

7. Show that the 8-puzzle states are divided into two disjoint sets, such that any state is reachable from any other state in the same set, while no state is reachable from any state in the other set. (Hint: See Berlekamp et al. (1982).) Devise a procedure to decide which set a given state is in, and explain why this is useful for generating random states. --(10) Create

9.Prove that Universal Instantiation is sound and that Existential Instantiation produces an inferentially equivalent knowledge base.--(8) Evaluate

10.4 Up to now we have assumed that the plans we create always make sure that an actionís preconditions are satisfied. Let us now investigate what propositional successor-state axioms such as HaveArrowt+1 ? (HaveArrowt ? ¨Shoott ) have to say about actions whose preconditions are not satisfied. a. Show that the axioms predict that nothing will happen when an action is executed in a state where its preconditions are not satisfied. b. Consider a plan p that contains the actions required to achieve a goal but also includes illegal actions. Is it the case that initial state ? successor-state axioms ? p |= goal ? c. With first-order successor-state axioms in situation calculus, is it possible to prove that a plan containing illegal actions will achieve the goal?--(10) Create
