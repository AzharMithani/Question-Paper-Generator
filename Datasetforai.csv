First, make up a suitable value for P(s | ¬m), and use it to calculate unnormalized values for P(m | s) and P(¬m | s) (i.e., ignoring the P(s) term in the Bayes’ rule expression, Equation (13.14)). Now normalize these values so that they add to 1",,,,,,,,,,
13," Show that the statement of conditional independence P(X,Y |Z)=P(X |Z)P(Y |Z) is equivalent to each of the statements P(X |Y,Z)=P(X |Z) and P(B |X,Z)=P(Y |Z) .",,,,,,,,,,
13,"Let X, Y , Z be Boolean random variables. Label the eight entries in the joint distribution P(X,Y,Z) as a through h. Express the statement that X and Y are conditionally independent given Z, as a set of equations relating a through h. How manynonredundant equations are there? ",,,,,,,,,,
14,"We have a bag of three biased coins a, b, and c with probabilities of coming up heads of 20%, 60%, and 80%, respectively. One coin is drawn randomly from the bag (with equal likelihood of drawing each of the three coins), and then the coin is flipped three times to generate the outcomes X1, X2, and X3. a. Draw the Bayesian network corresponding to this setup and define the necessary CPTs. b. Calculate which coin was most likely to have been drawn from the bag if the observed flips come out heads twice and tails once.",,,,,,,,,,
14,"Consider the Bayesian network in Figure 14.2. a. If no evidence is observed, are Burglary and Earthquake independent? Prove this from the numerical semantics and from the topological semantics. b. If we observe Alarm = true, are Burglary and Earthquake independent? Justify your answer by calculating whether the probabilities involved satisfy the definition of conditional independence",,,,,,,,,,
14,"Suppose that in a Bayesian network containing an unobserved variable Y , all the variables in the Markov blanket MB(Y ) have been observed. a. Prove that removing the node Y from the network will not affect the posterior distribution for any other unobserved variable in the network. b. Discuss whether we can remove Y if we are planning to use (i) rejection sampling and (ii) likelihood weighting.",,,,,,,,,,
14,"The probit distribution defined on page 522 describes the probability distribution for a Boolean child, given a single continuous parent. a. How might the definition be extended to cover multiple continuous parents? b. How might it be extended to handle a multivalued child variable? Consider both cases where the child’s values are ordered (as in selecting a gear while driving, depending on speed, slope, desired acceleration, etc.) and cases where they are unordered (as in selecting bus, train, or car to get to work)",,,,,,,,,,
14,"Consider the network shown in Figure 14.22(ii), and assume that the two telescopes work identically. N ? {1, 2, 3} and M1, M2 ? {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, with the symbolic CPTs as described in Exercise 14.12. Using the enumeration algorithm (Figure 14.9 on page 525), calculate the probability distribution P(N | M1 = 2, M2 = 2).",,,,,,,,,,
